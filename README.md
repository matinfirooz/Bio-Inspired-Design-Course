# Bio-Inspired Design Course

## Introduction
This course is an introduction to the bio-inspired artificial intelligence that is emerging in the twenty-first century. For almost fifty years, mainstream artificial intelligence focused on creating computers and algorithms that exhibited human cognitive abilities. Over time, it gradually moved away from its original source of inspiration—biological intelligence—and became increasingly focused on efficient signal processing, optimal control, and data mining. This course revisits biological systems to inspire novel computational techniques and intelligent algorithms.
